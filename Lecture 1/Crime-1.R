#----------------Unique Identifier-Check for Duplicates and Missing Values--------------------------------#
#quick check for duplicates. create dataset a of unique observations in crime.
#if number of observations in a = number of observations in crime then we have no duplicates. move on.
#a has 2018 observations so we know we need to investigate duplicates further.
a=unique(crime$communityname)
a=as.data.frame(a)
#to investigate further we use table. This tells us number of duplicates for every observation.
table=data.frame(table(crime$communityname))
#subset this dataset to be only the duplicates (frequency not equal to 1)
duplicates=table[table$Freq!=1,]
#below is an example of %in%
x=c(1,2,3,4)
y=c(1,1,7,3)
y%in%x
#use %in% to subset crime to keep only duplicated values for city name
crime_dups=crime[crime$communityname%in%duplicates$Var1,]
#use arrange to sort alphabetically
crime_dups=arrange(crime_dups,communityname)
#this led us to the conclusion that cityname alone is not a good unique identifier
#this is because muliple states can have the same city name
#below we create our own unique identifier by concatenating cityname and state
crime$citystate=paste(crime$communityname,crime$state)

#start the process over. use unique as a quick check for duplicates.
#2215 values for b means there are no duplicates for our variable citystate. move on.

#we look at the data and see the dbl,Int and factors
#in data cleaning, a key goal is to make sure that data is represented in R as it was intended to be represented
#explain variable types (numeric, character, logical, factor)
#look at attribute information on data website, tells us the 5 factor variables we have. we see that we have extra factor variables.
#convert variable type, lets give this example

a=2
#use class to ask R for the variable type ( run a, then class )

# to change to character use as.character ( u can use as.datafram to change list to dataframe)

#lets do it first on one variable from Fac to Num
#to refer to a variable in a dataset, use dataset$variable name

a=c(1,2,3)
#sapply returns vector
b=sapply(a,function(x) x*2)

# now lets do this on our dataset
# we will creat crime2 inorder to compare  esp when using glimpse

#in R if you change factor to numeric, sometimes it creats hidden issues like errors, 
#so the best way is to change factors to characters firs then change characters to numeric
